Hello! Welcome to my GitHub!

I started this page during the start of the pandemic, I started completely blind and so much of my earlier commits on this page are definitely not up to par. I plan to continue updating my page as I gain more skills and test new languages and frameworks â€” I suppose it's like a showcase resume, if anything? Testing and implementing new frameworks is fun, I can't wait to see how this page will develop overtime!

- This was my first website design; this whole version was built completely from scratch without any prior knowledge of web design. It was a fun introduction into web development.
